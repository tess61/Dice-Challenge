# Dicee Challenge

This is a simple dice game project developed as part of an online course. The game allows two players to roll dice, with the player who rolls the higher number winning the game.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:
```plaintext
Dicee Challenge/ 
├── images/ # Folder containing dice images 
├── dicee.html # HTML structure for the game 
├── index.js # JavaScript logic for the game 
└── styles.css # CSS styling for the game
```

## How to Play

1. Open the `dicee.html` file in a web browser.
2. Two dice will be rolled automatically each time the page is refreshed.
3. The player with the higher dice roll wins.
4. If both dice have the same number, it’s a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game elements.
